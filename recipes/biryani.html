    <h2 >Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Basmati rice

        </li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 lb (450g) bone-in chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li> teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>Cashews and raisins (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the same pan used for frying onions, add the marinated chicken and cook until it's no longer pink. Remove
            from heat.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a large pot, start layering the biryani. Begin with a layer of rice, then add a
            layer of chicken, some fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves. Repeat the layers until all the
            ingredients are used up.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle a pinch of saffron strands soaked in warm milk over the top layer of rice for
            added aroma and color.</li>
        <li>over the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes,
            allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let the biryani rest, covered, for
            another 10-15 minutes. This helps the flavors to fully develop.</li>
        <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers. Serve the Chicken Biryani hot,
            garnished with more fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves. Enjoy your flavorful masterpiece!</li>
